**Stylo is in early development, while it is useable we cannot make any
stability guarantees.**

Stylo is a Python library that allows you to create images and animations
powered by your imagination and a little mathematics. While mathematics is very
much at the core you do not have to be a mathematician to use it!

Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Stylo is available for Python 3.5+ and can be installed using Pip:

.. code::

    $ pip install stylo

Be sure to check out the `documentation <https://alcarney.github.io/stylo>`_
(under construction) for details on how to get started with stylo.

Contributing
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Contributions are welcome! Be sure to checkout the `Contributing
<https://alcarney.github.io/stylo/contributing/>`_ section of the documentation
to get started.

**Note:** While :code:`stylo` itself supports Python 3.5+, due to some of the
development tools we use you need to have Python 3.6+ in order to contribute
**code** to the library. Other versions of Python work just as well if you are
looking to contribute documentation.
