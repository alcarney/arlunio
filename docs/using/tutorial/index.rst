   Resetting the Tutorial
   ----------------------

   You are free to play around with and change **any** of the code you see here
   in this tutorial - in fact we encourage it! The only way you are truly going
   to develop an intuition for how the various concepts in stylo interact is to
   experiment. Dont't worry about breaking anything either, if you ever get to
   the point where you wish you could start over you can! At any time you can
   relaunch the tutorial with the command :code:`stylo tutorial --reset` which
   will reset **everything** back to its default state so that you can start
   fresh.

   **This command will revert any changes you make to the tutorial - including
   deleting any additional notebooks you have created. Be sure to back up anything
   you wish to save before running this command.**
