   cartesian coordinates
      The "standard" coordinate system that (in 2D) uses two variables :math:`(x, y)`
      to address a point in space. Can be thought of as going
      *"along the corridor and up the stairs"*. See :ref:`math_cartesian_coordinates`

   docstrings
      docstrings are a special kind of comment in Python and are typically found
      at the start of functions and classes. They outline what the purpose of
      the object/class is, what input it expects and what it returns along with
      any errors it may raise.

   polar coordinates
      An alternate coordinate system that (in 2D) uses two variables :math:`(r, \theta)`
      to address a point in space. Useful for curves and circular objects.
      See :ref:`math_polar_coordinates`

   linting
      Linting in software development is the process of running one or more tools
      against a codebase that search for potential issues. Examples include undefined
      variables or enforcing stylistic conventions such as line length.

   linear interpolation
      TBW

   transpose
       Transposing a matrix is the act of flipping the matrix around its principal
       diagonal. *All the columns become rows and the rows become columns*.

   tox
      `tox <https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is tool commonly found in
      Python projects that automates the process of running various tasks
      against multiple Python versions or environments.

   Travis
      `Travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_ is a continuous integration service that
      will automatically run the tests whenever changes are made to the
      repository and will report on any failures. It can also be configured to
      handle releases.
